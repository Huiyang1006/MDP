Instruction to run the code:

My compiler:
openjdk version "17" 2021-09-14 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu17.28+13-CA (build 17+35-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu17.28+13-CA (build 17+35-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
(I've been coding with my MacBook with Apple silicon. So I use Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK.)
