Instruction to run the code:

->Compile all files by using command "javac *.java".
->After compiling run the program by using command "java Demo". 
->You can also run the program with Intellij IDEA.

My compiler:
openjdk version "17" 2021-09-14 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu17.28+13-CA (build 17+35-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu17.28+13-CA (build 17+35-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
(I've been coding with my MacBook with Apple silicon. So I use Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK.)

The program reads from the mdp_input.txt file and get all information the program needs.

The program executes first the value iteration algorithm and then the policy iteration algorithm.
